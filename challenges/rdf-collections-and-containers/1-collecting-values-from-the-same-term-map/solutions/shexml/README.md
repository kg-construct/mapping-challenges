# ShExML solutions for mapping challenges
Here you can see the solutions for mapping challenges using the ShExML language. The solutions are tested with the latest ShExML engine version to date (i.e., v0.2.5) and you can test them in the ShExML web playground [here](https://herminiogg.github.io/mapping-challenges/challenges/solutions.html).

Rationale and foundations for them are explained in the companion paper:
