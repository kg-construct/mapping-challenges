* collecting values from a reference object maps

# 2b-collecting-values-from-different-termmaps-with-multi-valued-term-maps

# 3-processing-empty-collections-and-containers

Provides cases in which no object map yields results for a collection and container; instructing the processor to generate an empty list or container or return nothing.

# 4-nested-collections-and-containers

Provides cases in which collections and containers are nested.

# 5-collections-and-containers-as-subjects

Provides cases in which collections and containers are the subject of a triple.
